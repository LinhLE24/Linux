Exercise 1
1.1)What the difference between Unix and Linux?
1.     UNIX operating system was created in the late 1960s at AT&T Bell Labs while Linux is an operating system built by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991.
2.     The main difference between Linux and Unix is that Linux is a clone of Unix
3.     The default Linux shell is BASH while the Unix shell is Bourne Shell.
4.     Linux threat detection and solution is fast while Unix users need longer waiting time to receive the appropriate fix patch.
5.     The versions of Linux are Redhat, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Solaris, while important versions of Unix are HP-UX, AIS, BSD, etc.
1.2)What is MINIX? Who is its author of MINIX?
Minix is an educational tool — to demonstrate operating system programming
Andrew S. Tanenbaumis author of MINIX
 1.3)Who is the author of Linux?
 Linus Torvalsin 1991
What is the relationship between Linux and MINIX?
MINIX is a close cousin of GNU/Linux
Linus Torvalds created the kernel using Minix host system, which led to Linux inheriting various features from Minix, such as the Minix file system.
1.2) Give the command to display the version of your Linux kernel.
uname -r
How to know if your kernel is stable or unstable?
My kernel version is 5.11.0-46-generic. My “y” is odd-> It’s unstable.
Base on this rule
 
Kernel version: "x.y.z"
if "y" is even => stable version
If "y" is odd=> development version (under progress and unstable)
1.3) Give the command to change your working directory to/etc
cd /ect
cd ../../etc
which kind of files are inside the/etc directory?
The /etc hierarchy contains configuration files , startup files, etc.
 
1.5) what is the utility of the options "-ltr" in the following command:
 
$ ls -ltr : To sort the file names in the last modification time in reverse order
-l option is to show the output as a long list along with various attributes like permissions, file sizes, use, group, modification time etc
-t option will sort the entries by modification date (with newest first)
-r will reverse the sorting order. As -t will sort by modification time with newest first, -r will cause the reverse, oldest entries will be shown first now.
1.6) What is the utility of the option"-r"in the following command and what is the difference between "-r"and "-R"in the following commands:
4)cp -r /home/osman/EPITA /home/backup/
Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command line.
5)cp -R /home/osman/EPITA /home/backup
Read all files under each directory, recursively. Follow all symbolic links, unlike -r.
1.7) what is the utility of the option"-n"used in the following command:
6)cat -n /etc/group
-n number all output lines
1.8)  what  is  the difference  between  the  following commands  when  applied  to ²file.txt²with initial permissions (-rwxrwxrwx). Give the permissions of ²file.txt²after each command and explain the difference between both commands (without sequential execution)
7)chmod ugo+rw file.txt
Grant All (users , group and others) can read and write with file.txt
 8)chmod 666  file.txt
All users can receive read and write with file.txt
1.9) what is the difference between options "-a"and "-A"in the following commands:
9)ls -a
a list all files include hidden files “.file”)
10)ls -A
A same as –a minus directories “.” and “..”
1.10) what is the utility of the option "-p"in the following command:
11) mkdir -p dir1/subdir1/small
You want to create dir1 folder and create subdir1 folder in dir1 folder and create small folder in subdir1 folder.
 
With the help of mkdir -p command will create all the directories necessaries to fulfill your request, not returning any error in case that directory exists.
 
1.11) what is the utility of the option "%s"in the following command:
12)date +%s
Displays a date format as Unix time (which is the number of seconds (no leap) since 1970-01-01).
1.12) Give the commands to:
13)Create a hard link called "hshortcut" for the file "file.txt"
$ touch file.txt
$ ln file.txt hshortcut
14)Create a soft link called "ssorthcut" for the file "file.txt"
$ ln -s file.txt sshortcut
 
1.13) what is the utility of the options "-lwc"in the following command:
15)wc -lwc file.txt
l : display the number of lines in file.txt
w : display the number of words in file.txt
c : display the number of bytes of the file.txt
1.14) Give the command to display only the before last line from a given file "file.txt"
answer: tail -1 file.txt
1.15) What is the difference between the following commands when applied to ²file.txt²with initial  permissions  (-rwxr--r--). Give  the  permissions  of ²file.txt² after  each  command  and explain the difference between both commands (without sequential execution):
16)chmod ugo+rw file.txt 
Grant all users read and write permissions for file.txt
17)chmod 620file.txt
Give read and write permissions to the owner, write to the group, and don't give permissions to all other users.
 
1.16) Give 5 different syntaxes to write a loop in bash
While loop
while [ <some test> ]
do
<commands>
done
Until loop
until [ <some test> ]
do
<commands>
done
For loop
for var in <list>
do
<commands>
done
Select loop
select var in <list>
do
<commands>
done
Loop with AWK
1.17) What is the utility of the options "-s", "-n", "-t", "-p" in the following read commands:
1)read -s var
Read input in silent. Don’t show input content.
2)read -n 8 var
read exactly 8 characters from the input
3)read -t 2 var
read input in 2 seconds
4)read -p "Could you please enter the value of the variable :" var
prompt the content in double quotes 
Could you please enter the value of the variable :
1.18) Explain the following the difference between “;”, “||”, “&&” in the following commands:
1) ls -l ; mkdir directory; cd directory; touch f{1..9}
The semicolon allows these commands will run sequentially
Lists all files in the current directory -> create directory folder -> move to directory folder -> create 9 files
2)ls -l file.txt || echo the file does not exist
|| is ‘or’.  Lists all information (permission,date/time created, byte etc) about file.txt  if the file.txt exists or print the file does not exist if the file.txt does not exist.
3)ls -l file.txt && echo the file exist
&& is ‘and’.  Lists all information (permission,date/time created, byte etc) about file.txt  and print the file exist
